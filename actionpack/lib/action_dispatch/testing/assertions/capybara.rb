    # Substitute <tt>rails-dom-testing</tt>-provided assertions with <tt>Capybara</tt>-powered assertions.
    #
    # By default, assertions about the contents of the response's body are provided by [rails-dom-testing][].
    #
    # Action Dispatch can also integrate with Capybara's selectors and assertions by including the <tt>ActionDispatch::Assertions::CapybaraAssertions</tt> module:
    #
    #
    #   require "test_helper"
    #   require "action_dispatch/testing/assertions/capybara"
    #
    #   class BlogFlowTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
    #     include ActionDispatch::Assertions::CapybaraAssertions
    #
    #     test "can see the welcome page" do
    #       get "/"
    #       assert_css "h1", "Welcome#index"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # In addition to the assertions provided by <tt>Capybara::Minitest::Assertions</tt>, <tt>ActionDispatch::Assertions::CapybaraAssertions</tt> also declares a <tt>within</tt> test helper to change the current scope and a <tt>page</tt> test helper to access the <tt>Capybara::Session</tt> directly.
    #
    # Mix the <tt>ActionDispatch::Assertions::CapybaraAssertions</tt> module into the <tt>ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest</tt> class to
    # integrate with Capybara's selectors and assertions throughout your integration test suite:
    #
