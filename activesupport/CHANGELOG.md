*   Fix an issue with `ActiveSupport::Notification` that caused random requests to fail in dev env and led to incorrect event data in some cases.

    Fixes #44167, #44348.

    *Janosch MÃ¼ller*

*   Add `ActiveSupport::TestCase#stub_const` to stub a constant for the duration of a yield.

    *DHH*

*   Fix `ActiveSupport::EncryptedConfiguration` to be compatible with Psych 4

    *Stephen Sugden*

*   Improve `File.atomic_write` error handling

*   Fix `Class#descendants` and `DescendantsTracker#descendants` compatibility with Ruby 3.1.

    [The native `Class#descendants` was reverted prior to Ruby 3.1 release](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14394#note-33),
    but `Class#subclasses` was kept, breaking the feature detection.

    *Jean Boussier*
