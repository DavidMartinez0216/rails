Opens a temporary file with the decrypted contents of config/secrets.yml.enc
to edit production secrets.

When the temporary file is next saved the contents are encrypted and written to
config/secrets.yml.enc while the file itself is destroyed to protect secrets
leaking.

Rails looks for the decryption key in config/secrets.yml.key as well as the
`RAILS_MASTER_KEY` environment variable, with the former taking precedence.

By default Rails adds `config/secrets.yml.key` and `config/secrets.yml.enc` to
`.gitignore`. If you don't use Git add these to the respective version control
ignore file to protect production keys.
