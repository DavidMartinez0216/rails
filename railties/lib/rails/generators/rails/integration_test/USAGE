Description:
    Stubs out a new requests test. Pass the name of the test, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, as an argument.

    This generator invokes the current requests tool, which defaults to
    TestUnit.

Example:
    `rails generate integration_test GeneralStories` creates a GeneralStories
    requests test in test/requests/general_stories_test.rb
