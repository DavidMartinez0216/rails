Description:
    Stubs out a new module in the lib directory. Pass in the module name and a list of optional method names.
    
    This is useful when writing custom modules for use in multiple models etc.
    
    This generates a custom module file in lib as well as a test in test/unit.

Example:
    `rails generate module custom method1 method2 method3`

        Module:      lib/custom.rb
        Test:      test/unit/custom_test.rb
