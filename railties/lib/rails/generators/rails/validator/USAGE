Description:
    Create a new ActiveModel validator. Pass the validator name
    either CamelCased or under_scored.

    You can also, optionally, pass a --each option to generate a new
    ActiveModel::EachValidator instead of a simple validator.

    If you pass a namespaced name (e.g. user/email or User::Email)
    then the generator will put the generated file under a folder with
    the namespace's name and put the validator class under a module.

Example:
    `rails generate validator Email`

      With TestUnit as your testing framework, it will generate
      the following files:

        Validator:  app/validators/email_validator.rb
        Test:       test/validators/email_validator_test.rb
