# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring
# files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your
# text editor or operating system, you probably want to add a
# global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore the generated bundler configuration files
/.bundle

# Ignore generated testing and documentation files
# /docs
# /rdocs
# /coverage

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Examples
#
# Ignore these types of files because they might contain secret data.
# Instead you should have the secret_token value saved as a ENV
# variable.
#
# /config/initializers/secret_token.rb
# /config/*.yml
#
# These directories are made by other version control software
# /.svn
# /.hg
