# Security Concern: Although it is very convenient to commit database.yml to source control and deploy
# it with the rest of the app, if you ever open-source your project then your database passwords
# will be open as well. Adding config/database.yml to your .gitignore file keep it from being in
# your deployed repository but will require you to SCP it to your server.
