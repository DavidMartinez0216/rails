*   `Model.all` now returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, rather than an
    array of records. Use `Model.to_a` or `Relation#to_a` if you really
    want an array.

    In some specific cases, this may cause breakage when upgrading.
    However in most cases the `ActiveRecord::Relation` will just act as a
    lazy-loaded array and there will be no problems.

    Note that calling `Model.all` with options (e.g.
    `Model.all(conditions: '...')` was already deprecated, but it will
    still return an array in order to make the transition easier.

    `Model.scoped` is deprecated in favour of `Model.all`.

    `Relation#all` still returns an array, but is deprecated (since it
    would serve no purpose if we made it return a `Relation`).
