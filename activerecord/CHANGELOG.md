*   Allow SchemaDumper to ignore schemas

    When generating the schema file, SchemaDumper can be instructed to ignore some schemas by adding either the schema name or a Regex to the `ignored_schemas` attribute. This works just like the functionality for ignoring tables.

    This can be used to ignore schemas that are automatically generated by extensions and cannot be re-created. For example, TimescaleDB creates several schemas to track it's internal configuration and metadata. These schemas are not created as part of loading the schema and will cause Rails database setup to fail.
