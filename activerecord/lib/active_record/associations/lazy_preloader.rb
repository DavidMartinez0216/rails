    class LazyPreloader
      # Implements the details of lazy eager loading of Active Record associations.
      #
      # Suppose that you have the following two Active Record models:
      #
      #   class Author < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     # columns: name, age
      #     has_many :books
      #   end
      #
      #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     # columns: title, sales, author_id
      #   end
      #
      # When you load an author with all associated books Active Record will make
      # only one query:
      #
      #   authors = Author.lazy_preload(:books).where(name: ['bell hooks', 'Homer']).to_a
      #
      #   => SELECT `authors`.* FROM `authors` WHERE `name` IN ('bell hooks', 'Homer')
      #
      # Then you probably will want to retrieve books while iterating authors
      #
      #   authors.each { |author| read author.books }
      #
      # And only after books method invocation second query will be executed
      # to load all books for authors in the collection:
      #
      # => SELECT `books`.* FROM `books` WHERE `author_id` IN (2, 5)
      #
