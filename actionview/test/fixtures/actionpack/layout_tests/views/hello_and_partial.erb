yield should render nothing, since empty block given to this view by Rails:
<%= yield %>

partial without block:
<%= render "partial_that_yields" %>
after partial

partial with block:
<%= render "partial_that_yields" do %>
  yielding block
<% end %>
after partial with block

partial with empty block:
<%= render "partial_that_yields" do %>
<% end %>
after partial with empty block
