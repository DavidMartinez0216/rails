Upgrading to Rails 5.0
----------------------

If you're upgrading an existing application, it's a great idea to have good test
coverage before going in. You should also first upgrade to Rails 4.2 in case you
haven't and make sure your application still runs as expected before attempting
to upgrade to Rails 5.0. A list of things to watch out for when upgrading is
available in the guide [Upgrading Ruby on
Rails](upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-4-2-to-rails-5-0).
