Action View Overview
====================

After reading this guide, you will know:

* What Action View is and how to use it with Rails.
* How best to use templates, partials, and layouts.
* How to use localized views.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Action View?
--------------------

In Rails, [Action Controller](action_controller_overview.html) and Action View work together to handle web requests. Action Controller is concerned with communicating with the model layer (of MVC) and retrieving data. Action View is then responsible for compiling a response to the web request using that data.

Action View templates (also referred to simply as "views") are written using Embedded Ruby (ERB), which allows using Ruby code within HTML documents.

Action View provides many [helper](#helpers) classes for dynamically generating HTML tags for forms, dates, and strings. It's also easy to add new helpers to your application as needed.

NOTE: Some features of Action View are tied to Active Record, but that doesn't mean Action View depends on Active Record. Action View is an independent package that can be used with any sort of Ruby libraries.

Using Action View with Rails
----------------------------

Action View templates (aka "views") are stored in a subdirectory in the `app/views` directory. There is a subdirectory matching the name of each controller. The view files inside that subdirectory are used to render specific views as a response to controller actions. The template files follow a naming convention.

For example, when we use scaffolding to generate an `article` resource, Rails generate the following files in `app/views/articles`:

```bash
$ bin/rails generate scaffold article
      [...]
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/articles
      create      app/views/articles/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
      [...]
```

The naming convention is that the views share their name with the associated controller action. For example the `index.html.erb`, `edit.html.erb`, etc. above.

By following this naming convention, Rails will automatically find and render the matching view at the end of a controller action, without you having to  specify it. For example, the `index` action in the `articles_controller.rb` will automatically render the `index.html.erb` view inside the `app/views/articles/` directory. The name and the location of the file are both important.

The final HTML returned to the client is composed of a combination of the `.html.erb` ERB file, a layout template that wraps it, and all the partials that the ERB file may reference. In the rest of this guide, you will find more details about each of the three components: `Templates`, `Partials`, `Layouts`.

Templates
---------

Action View templates can be written in different formats. If the template file has a `.erb` extension, it uses embedded Ruby to build a HTML response. If the template has a `.jbuilder` extension, it uses the [Jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder) gem to build a JSON response. And a template with a `.builder` extension uses the [`Builder::XmlMarkup`](https://github.com/jimweirich/builder) library to build an XML response.

Rails uses the file extension to distinguish among multiple template systems. For example, an HTML file using the ERB template system will have `.html.erb` as a file extension.

### ERB

When Rails processes the ERB view templates ending with `.html.erb`, it evaluates the embedded Ruby code and replaces the ERB tags with their respective outputs. The dynamic content generated by evaluating the embedded Ruby code is combined with the static HTML markup to form the final HTML response.

Within an ERB template, Ruby code can be included using both `<% %>` and `<%= %>` tags. The difference is that `<% %>` tag (without the `=`) is used to execute Ruby code that does not return anything, such as conditions, loops, or blocks. The tag `<%= %>` is used for embedded Ruby code that generates an output and you want to render that output in the template.

In the following example:

```html+erb
<h1>Names</h1>
<% @people.each do |person| %>
  Name: <%= person.name %><br>
<% end %>
```

The loop is set up using regular embedding tags (`<% %>`) and the name is inserted using the output embedding tags (`<%= %>`).

Note that functions such as `print` and `puts` won't be rendered to the view with ERB templates. So something like this would not work:

```html+erb
<%# WRONG %>
Hi, Mr. <% puts "Frodo" %>
```

To suppress leading and trailing whitespaces, you can use `<%-` `-%>` interchangeably with `<%` and `%>`.

### Jbuilder

`Jbuilder` is a gem that's maintained by the Rails team and included in the default Rails `Gemfile`. It is used to build a JSON response.

If you don't have it, you can add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jbuilder"
```

A `Jbuilder` object named `json` is automatically made available to templates with
a `.jbuilder` extension.

Here is a basic example:

```ruby
json.name("Alex")
json.email("alex@example.com")
```

would produce:

```json
{
  "name": "Alex",
  "email": "alex@example.com"
}
```

See the [Jbuilder documentation](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder#jbuilder) for
more examples.

### Builder

Builder templates are a more programmatic alternative to ERB. It's similar to `JBuilder` but is used to generate XML, instead of JSON.

An `XmlMarkup` object named `xml` is automatically made available to templates with a `.builder` extension.

Here is a basic examples:

```ruby
xml.em("emphasized")
xml.em { xml.b("emph & bold") }
xml.a("A Link", "href" => "https://rubyonrails.org")
xml.target("name" => "compile", "option" => "fast")
```

which would produce:

```html
<em>emphasized</em>
<em><b>emph &amp; bold</b></em>
<a href="https://rubyonrails.org">A link</a>
<target option="fast" name="compile" />
```

Any method with a block will be treated as an XML markup tag with nested markup in the block. For example, the following:

```ruby
xml.div {
  xml.h1(@person.name)
  xml.p(@person.bio)
}
```

would produce something like:

```html
<div>
  <h1>David Heinemeier Hansson</h1>
  <p>A product of Danish Design during the Winter of '79...</p>
</div>
```

### Template Caching

By default, Rails will compile each template to a method to render it. In the development environment, when you alter a template, Rails will check the file's modification time and recompile it.

Partials
--------

Partial templates - usually just called "partials" - are another device for breaking the rendering process into more manageable chunks. With partials, you can extract pieces of code from your templates to separate files and also reuse them throughout your templates.

### Rendering Partials

To render a partial as part of a view, you use the `render` method within the view:

```erb
<%= render "menu" %>
```

This will render a file named `_menu.html.erb` at that point within the view that is being rendered. Note the leading underscore character: partials are named with a leading underscore to distinguish them from regular views, even though they are referred to without the underscore. This holds true even when you're pulling in a partial from another folder:

```erb
<%= render "application/menu" %>
```

That code will pull in the partial from `app/views/application/_menu.html.erb`.

### Using Partials to Simplify Views

One way to use partials is to treat them as the equivalent of subroutines; a way to move details out of a view so that you can grasp what's going on more easily. For example, you might have a view that looks like this:

```html+erb
<%= render "application/ad_banner" %>

<h1>Products</h1>

<p>Here are a few of our fine products:</p>
<% @products.each do |product| %>
  <%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: product } %>
<% end %>

<%= render "application/footer" %>
```

Here, the `_ad_banner.html.erb` and `_footer.html.erb` partials could contain content that is shared among many pages in your application. You don't need to see the details of these sections when you're concentrating on a particular page.

TIP: View partials rely on the same [Template
Inheritance](/layouts_and_rendering.html#template-inheritance) as templates and
layouts, so templates rendered by controllers that inherit from
`ApplicationController` can render view partials declared in
`app/views/application`.

In addition to resolving partials with the inheritance chain, controllers can
also override default partials with the inheritance chain. For example, a
`ProductsController` that inherits from `ApplicationController` will resolve a
call to `<%= render "ad_banner" %>` by first searching for
`app/views/products/_ad_banner.html.erb` before falling back to
`app/views/application/_ad_banner.html.erb`.

### `render` with `locals` Option

When rendering a partial, each key in the `locals:` option is available as a
partial-local variable:

```html+erb
<%# app/views/products/show.html.erb %>

<%= render partial: "products/product", locals: { product: @product } %>

<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>

<%= tag.div id: dom_id(product) do %>
  <h1><%= product.name %></h1>
<% end %>
```

If a template refers to a variable that isn't passed into the view as part of
the `locals:` option, the template will raise an `ActionView::Template::Error`:

```html+erb
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>

<%= tag.div id: dom_id(product) do %>
  <h1><%= product.name %></h1>

  <%# => raises ActionView::Template::Error %>
  <% related_products.each do |related_product| %>
    <%# ... %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

### Using `local_assigns`

Each key in the `locals:` option is available as a partial-local variable through the [local_assigns][] helper method:

```html+erb
<%# app/views/products/show.html.erb %>

<%= render partial: "products/product", locals: { product: @product } %>

<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>

<% local_assigns[:product]          # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>" %>
<% local_assigns[:options]          # => nil %>
```

Since `local_assigns` is a `Hash`, it's compatible with [Ruby 3.1's pattern matching assignment operator](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/syntax/pattern_matching_rdoc.html):

```ruby
local_assigns => { product:, **options }
product # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>"
options # => {}
```

When keys other than `:product` are assigned into a partial-local `Hash`
variable, they can be splatted into helper method calls:

```html+erb
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>

<% local_assigns => { product:, **options } %>

<%= tag.div id: dom_id(product), **options do %>
  <h1><%= product.name %></h1>
<% end %>

<%# app/views/products/show.html.erb %>

<%= render "products/product", product: @product, class: "card" %>
<%# => <div id="product_1" class="card">
  #      <h1>A widget</h1>
  #    </div>
%>
```

Pattern matching assignment also supports variable renaming:

```ruby
local_assigns => { product: record }
product             # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>"
record              # => "#<Product:0x0000000109ec5d10>"
product == record   # => true
```

Since `local_assigns` returns a `Hash` instance, you can conditionally read a variable, then fall back to a default value when the key isn't part of the `locals:` options:

```html+erb
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>

<% local_assigns.fetch(:related_products, []).each do |related_product| %>
  <%# ... %>
<% end %>
```

Combining Ruby 3.1's pattern matching assignment with calls to [Hash#with_defaults](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Hash.html#method-i-with_defaults) enables compact partial-local default variable assignments:

```html+erb
<%# app/views/products/_product.html.erb %>

<% local_assigns.with_defaults(related_products: []) => { product:, related_products: } %>

<%= tag.div id: dom_id(product) do %>
  <h1><%= product.name %></h1>

  <% related_products.each do |related_product| %>
    <%# ... %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

INFO: By default, partials will accept any `locals` as keyword arguments. To define what `locals` a partial accepts, use a `locals:` magic comment. To learn more, read about [Strict Locals](#strict-locals).

### `render` without `partial` and `locals` Options

In the above example, `render` takes 2 options: `partial` and `locals`. But if
these are the only options you want to pass, you can skip using these options.
For example, instead of:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @product } %>
```

You can also do:

```erb
<%= render "product", product: @product %>
```

### The `as` and `object` Options

By default `ActionView::Partials::PartialRenderer` has its object in a local variable with the same name as the template. So, given:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product" %>
```

within `_product` partial we'll get `@product` in the local variable `product`,
as if we had written:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @product } %>
```

The `object` option can be used to directly specify which object is rendered into the partial; useful when the template's object is elsewhere (e.g. in a different instance variable or in a local variable).

For example, instead of:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: @item } %>
```

we would do:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", object: @item %>
```

With the `as` option, we can specify a different name for the said local variable. For example, if we wanted it to be `item` instead of `product` we would do:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", object: @item, as: "item" %>
```

This is equivalent to

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", locals: { item: @item } %>
```

### Rendering Collections

Commonly, a template will need to iterate over a collection and render a sub-template for each of the elements. This pattern has been implemented as a single method that accepts an array and renders a partial for each one of the elements in the array.

So this example for rendering all the products:

```erb
<% @products.each do |product| %>
  <%= render partial: "product", locals: { product: product } %>
<% end %>
```

can be rewritten in a single line:

```erb
<%= render partial: "product", collection: @products %>
```

When a partial is called with a collection, the individual instances of the partial have access to the member of the collection being rendered via a variable named after the partial. In this case, the partial is `_product`, and within it, you can refer to `product` to get the collection member that is being rendered.

You can use a shorthand syntax for rendering collections. Assuming `@products` is a collection of `Product` instances, you can simply write the following to produce the same result:

```erb
<%= render @products %>
```

Rails determines the name of the partial to use by looking at the model name in the collection, `Product` in this case. In fact, you can even render a collection made up of instances of different models using this shorthand, and Rails will choose the proper partial for each member of the collection.

### Spacer Templates

You can also specify a second partial to be rendered between instances of the main partial by using the `:spacer_template` option:

```erb
<%= render partial: @products, spacer_template: "product_ruler" %>
```

Rails will render the `_product_ruler` partial (with no data passed to it) between each pair of `_product` partials.

### Strict Locals

By default, templates will accept any `locals` as keyword arguments. To define what `locals` a template accepts, add a `locals:` magic comment:

```erb
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>

<%# locals: (message:) -%>
<%= message %>
```

Rendering the partial without a `:message` local variable argument will raise an exception:

```ruby
render "messages/message"
# => ActionView::Template::Error: missing local: :message for app/views/messages/_message.html.erb
```

Default values can also be provided:

```erb
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>

<%# locals: (message: "Hello, world!") -%>
<%= message %>
```

Rendering the partial without a `:message` local variable uses the provided default value:

```ruby
render "messages/message"
# => "Hello, world!"
```

Rendering the partial with additional local variable arguments will raise an exception:

```ruby
render "messages/message", unknown_local: "will raise"
# => ActionView::Template::Error: missing local: :unknown_local for app/views/messages/_message.html.erb
```

Optional local variable arguments can be splatted:

```erb
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>

<%# locals: (message: "Hello, world!", **attributes) -%>
<%= tag.p(message, **attributes) %>
```

Or `locals` can be disabled entirely:

```erb
<%# app/views/messages/_message.html.erb %>

<%# locals: () %>
```

Rendering the partial with any local variable arguments will raise an exception:

```ruby
render "messages/message", unknown_local: "will raise"
# => ActionView::Template::Error: no locals accepted for app/views/messages/_message.html.erb
```

Action View will process the `locals:` magic comment in any templating engine that supports `#`-prefixed comments, and will read the magic comment from any line in the partial.

CAUTION: Only keyword arguments are supported. Defining positional or block arguments will raise an Action View Error at render-time.

Layouts
-------

Layouts can be used to render a common view template around the results of Rails controller actions. Typically, a Rails application will have a couple of layouts that pages will be rendered within. For example, a site might have one layout for a logged in user and another for the marketing or sales side of the site. The logged in user layout might include top-level navigation that should be present across many controller actions. The sales layout for a SaaS app might include top-level navigation for things like "Pricing" and "Contact Us" pages. You would expect each layout to have a different look and feel. You can read about layouts in more detail in the [Layouts and Rendering in Rails](layouts_and_rendering.html) guide.

### Partial Layouts

Partials can have their own layouts applied to them. These layouts are different from those applied to a controller action, but they work in a similar fashion.

Let's say we're displaying an article on a page which should be wrapped in a `div` for display purposes. Firstly, we'll create a new `Article`:

```ruby
Article.create(body: 'Partial Layouts are cool!')
```

In the `show` template, we'll render the `_article` partial wrapped in the `box` layout:

**articles/show.html.erb**

```erb
<%= render partial: 'article', layout: 'box', locals: { article: @article } %>
```

The `box` layout simply wraps the `_article` partial in a `div`:

**articles/_box.html.erb**

```html+erb
<div class='box'>
  <%= yield %>
</div>
```

Note that the partial layout has access to the local `article` variable that was passed into the `render` call. However, unlike application-wide layouts, partial layouts still have the underscore prefix.

You can also render a block of code within a partial layout instead of calling `yield`. For example, if we didn't have the `_article` partial, we could do this instead:

**articles/show.html.erb**

```html+erb
<% render(layout: 'box', locals: { article: @article }) do %>
  <div>
    <p><%= article.body %></p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Supposing we use the same `_box` partial from above, this would produce the same output as the previous example.

Helpers
-------

Rails provides many helper methods to use with Action View. These include methods for:

* Formatting dates, strings and numbers
* Creating HTML links to images, videos, stylesheets, etc...
* Sanitizing content
* Creating forms
* Localizing content

You can learn more about helpers in the [Action View Helpers
Guide](action_view_helpers.html) and the [Action View Form Helpers
Guide](form_helpers.html).

Localized Views
---------------

Action View has the ability to render different templates depending on the current locale.

For example, suppose you have an `ArticlesController` with a show action. By default, calling this action will render `app/views/articles/show.html.erb`. But if you set `I18n.locale = :de`, then `app/views/articles/show.de.html.erb` will be rendered instead. If the localized template isn't present, the undecorated version will be used. This means you're not required to provide localized views for all cases, but they will be preferred and used if available.

You can use the same technique to localize the rescue files in your public directory. For example, setting `I18n.locale = :de` and creating `public/500.de.html` and `public/404.de.html` would allow you to have localized rescue pages.

Since Rails doesn't restrict the symbols that you use to set I18n.locale, you can leverage this system to display different content depending on anything you like. For example, suppose you have some "expert" users that should see different pages from "normal" users. You could add the following to `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`:

```ruby
before_action :set_expert_locale

def set_expert_locale
  I18n.locale = :expert if current_user.expert?
end
```

Then you could create special views like `app/views/articles/show.expert.html.erb` that would only be displayed to expert users.

You can read more about the Rails Internationalization (I18n) API [here](i18n.html).
